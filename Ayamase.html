<h3> Description</h3>
<p>Ayamase also called designer stew is the ‘fraternal twin’ of Ofada stew. The same ingredients are used except for tomatoes and instead of using the red bell pepper; you use green bell pepper. You can use a variety of green peppers and chillies you want.
    This stew requires a lot of patience when cooking and in my opinion, it tastes a lot better when left to rest for some few minutes or hours before serving. 
    Similar to the ofada stew, one of the processes involved for making ayamase stew entails bleaching palm oil which can be very dangerous if not handled with care.
</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<p> <ul>
    
    <li>800g Assorted meat cut into small pieces (combination of smoked turkey, ponmo, shaki and smoked beef)</li>
   
    <li>6 Large green bell peppers</li>

    <li>3 Medium onions, chop a half bulb and reserve</li>
    
   <li> 3 Red or orange scotch bonnet (use according to preference)</li>
    
   <li> 6 Boiled eggs, peeled</li>
    
   <li> 4 Tbsp Iru woro (locust beans)</li>
    
   <li> 3 Tbsp bouillon powder (I used jumbo brand)</li>
    
    <li> Salt to taste </li>
    
    <li> Cups cooking spoon of palm oil </li>
    
    <li> Tbsp ground crayfish (optional) </li></ul>  
</p>


<h3>How to bleach Palm Oil</h3>
<p> <ol>
    <li>Place a clean and sturdy pan on low heat, pour palm oil and bleach till palm oil is transparent but not black (this should take about 15 to 20 minutes if done on low heat). </li>
    <li>Alternatively, keep the pot covered during the whole process to avoid a smoky kitchen. </li>
    <li>Do a pepper test for the oil; dip a white paper in the oil and if it comes out clean and translucent then it’s ok to be used for the stew. </li> 
        <ul>(Tip) Please ensure you keep your kitchen well ventilated during this process.
        If you see the residue in the oil, allow the palm oil to cool down a bit and swap pan to a clean one then carefully pour the oil leaving the dirt out. </ul> </ol> 

<h3>Directions</h3>
<p> <ol> 
    <li> Swap clean pan with bleached palm oil on medium heat, and then add the chopped onions, then the locust beans. </li>
    <li>After about 30 seconds of frying add the cubed assorted meat and fry until golden (anything between 3 to 5 minutes) </li>
    <li> Add the boiled pepper and cook for about 5 minutes. </li>
    <li>Add little water to dilute if the sauce is thick and reduce the heat. </li> 
    <li>Add boiled eggs, stir in gently so as not to break them.</li>
    <li> Add bouillon powder and salt to taste, add crayfish and continue to cook on low heat, don't forget to stir in between to avoid burning. 
    (you can either leave the pot open or cover with a lid. I don’t cover with a lid as I cook on low heat which reduces splatter) </li>
    <li>Continue to cook the stew until palm oil floats on the top and the colour of the pepper is changed from green to brown.
     To rest for about 5 minutes and serve with boiled ofada rice or plain boiled rice. Optional: Serve with yams as well. </li> </ol></p>
