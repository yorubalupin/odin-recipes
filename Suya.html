<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Suya is a West African kebab. It is thinly slice meat, usually beef, ram or chicken, seasoned with a spicy peanut mixture and cooked over open flame. 
It is the Nigerian national dish and is the most popular street food.
 Suya is also popular in Ghana and Cameroon. 
 The different suya recipes are the result of individuals personal recipes rather than distinctive national differences in this particular cuisine. 
 They are all made with peanuts ground with spices, skewered and cooked over open flame. 
 What is readily available and personal preferences has more to do with the different suya recipes than a national culinary identity.</p>

    <li> 1 Teaspoon garlic powder </li>
    <li> 1 Teaspoon cayenne pepper powder </li>
    <li> Teaspoon freshly ground black pepper </li>
    <li> 1/4 Teaspoon ground cloves </li>
    <li> 1/4 Teaspoon ground nutmeg </li>
   </ul>
 </p>

 <p> <h4>For the Chicken Suya</h4>

    <li> 3 tablespoons neutral cooking oil 
    (any neutral oil will work.) </li>
</ul>
 </p>

 <h3>Directions</h3>

 <h4>For the Yaji</h4>

 <ol> <li>Combine all ingredients in a jar with a lid.
    Secure the lid and shake to combine. 
    This mix will keep on the counter, but we like to make a bigger batch and store in the fridge or freezer, where it will keep for six months.</li>
 </ol>
<h4>For the Chicken Suya</h4>

<ol>
    <li>If using wooden skewers, soak them for at least 30 minutes in cold water so they don’t burn during cooking. </li>
    <li>Cut the chicken breasts into at least 1-inch to 1 1/2-inch cubes.</li>
    <li>Place chicken chunks in a large mixing bowl and drizzle the peanut oil over it.</li> 
    <li>Sprinkle a scant 1/2 cup of yajin kuli over the chicken, reserving the rest to serve. </li>
    <li>Toss carefully to ensure all the pieces are evenly coated in the blend.</li>
    <li>Thread about 6 to 8 pieces chicken cubes onto each skewer with the pointy end up.</li>
    <li>Don't leave any space between pieces: You don't want any of the skewer exposed except for a 2 - 3 inch section at the bottom that serves as a handle. 
        Repeat for the rest of the chicken.</li>
</ol>

<h5>To broil</h5>
<ol>
    <li> the broiler to high and position a rack 6 to 8 inches from the heat source.
    <li> Place the chicken skewers on a lightly greased baking sheet and cook for 8 to 10 minutes, 
    turning halfway through.

</ol>

<h5>To cook on stovetop</h5>
<ol>
    <li>Heat a grill pan to medium heat and lightly oil with peanut oil (or other high smoke point oil you have).</li>
    <li> for 10 to 12 minutes, giving a quarter turn every 3 to 4 minutes until all sides are cooked.</li>

</ol>

<h5>To grill</h5>
<ol>
    <li> Light the grill and lightly grease the grates.</li>
    <li> Place the skewers on the grill and cook for 5 to 6 minutes. 
        Flip and cook for an additional 2 to 3 minutes. 
        If the chicken isn't completely cooked, move to indirect heat until the temperature registers 160°F. </li>
</ol>

<h4>To serve</h4>

<Ul>
    <li>Transfer chicken to a platter and rest for a few minutes. Serve with fresh sliced tomatoes, red onions, and cilantro. </li>
